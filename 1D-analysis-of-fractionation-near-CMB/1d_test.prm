# The factor that is referred to as alpha in the manuscript is the ratio of the 
# chemical diffusivit and the isotope fractionation factor. 
# The value from the manusript, alpha = 2.9, assumes that the fraction of iron54
# is close to 1, which is not given in out setup. Hence, we have to use a factor of
# 2.9/(1-0.27)=3.97 here (where 0.27 is the ratio of iron57 to iron54).
